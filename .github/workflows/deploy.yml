# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: eb-github-action test CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "dev" ] # dev에 push가 될 때 CD가 일어나도록 핸들링

  #Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  #workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
